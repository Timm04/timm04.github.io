It's there to supplement your immersion by having you learn new expressions in an efficient manner.</li> <li>You learn the word in Anki and aquire it with Immersion aferwards. Meaning for every card in Anki you learn one meaning (and reading) at a time. Expressions with more than one meaning/usages are going to be then aquired through immersion and should not be worried about in the beginning. The same goes for when a word has multiple readings. Learn one meaning and reading at a time for one expression.</li> <li>Immersion is where you aquire language whereas Anki is used to remember information i.e new expressions in the long term.</li> <li>Of course there are gonna be days where you cannot immerse, but make sure to do at least your reviews, every day.</li> <li>Take at absolute maxium 10 seconds per card while reviewing or learning new expressions.</li> <li>If you can't remember something in 10 seconds, then most likely you won't remember it in 15, 30 seconds or even minutes. So fail the card if you can't remember it in that timeframe. 10 seconds is a maxium, try to aim for under 5 seconds.</li> <li>Don't spend too much time in Anki. Nobody should spend more than 1 hour in Anki.</li> <li>Aim for at least 80% retention, anything above 90% is optimal.</li> <li>At the beginning your retention will probably be shit, because its a new language for you, but don't worry about retention too much at the beginning. Focus on understanding and take your time.</li> <li>Anki should be make up 1/5 of your Japanese time. 4/5 of the time should be spent immersing.</li> <li>At the beginning you can't really immerse because you lack grammar and vocab so aim for a 1/3 split, where each third is Anki, grammar study and optionally Immersion.</li> <li>Use vocab cards and remove any hints from the front of the card. The goal hereby is to create a situation where you only have the word as the only information present to recall it. This way you are forced to recall the word purely based on the word itself. No sentences from which you could derive the meaning or audio on the front or really anything else. Reason being, with sentence cards your brain will most likely, unconsciously or not, use the context, length and or shape of the sentence and where the word comes up in the sentence or really any unique aspect of will give you clues to help you answer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Mindset%20and%20Mental%20Game.html#mining","title":"Mining","text":"<ul> <li>Don't mine everything. Mine only expressions that you understand within the context of the sentence. Context is key, since the greater impression an expression/context has on you, the easier you will remember a word in Anki.</li> <li>You can boost the impression of an expression by creating as many associations with the card you can, most prominently adding more meaningful pictures to the card. Meaningful here means anything that makes YOU remember the card more easily.</li> <li>Do not mine something just for the Kanji, meaning if the word is more commonly used in Hiragana/Katakana then do not mine the Kanji.</li> <li>Mining too much will result in a backlog, which is not bad, but a few things to consider.</li> <li>If you know a new card already then suspend it. Chances are high you aquired it already through immersion.</li> <li> <ul> <li>Try to maintain a backlog, so you don't run out of Anki cards.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>This will be handy when you don't have time to immerse and can only do Anki for the day.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>Backlog sizes vary from person to person. You should experiment yourself how big you like your backlog to be.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Don't mine anything over 30k at the beginning.</li> <li>Only when reading becomes effortless start the monolingual transition.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Mindset%20and%20Mental%20Game.html#immersion","title":"Immersion","text":"<ul> <li>Balance ambiguity and understanding. Try to immerse in something that is challenging but also fun. Fun is another way to say you understand something enough to enjoy it. Challenging can mean many different things. Challenging can be when you know all the words but not the grammar in a sentence or the vice versa. Challenging can be even when you understand every word and grammar but still need your time to understand what is actually being said. What I mean with challenging here, is having immersion content where most sentences, if not all, have at max 2 unknown pieces of information you don't know. At best every sentence has 1 unknown information, meaning the context of the sentence can help you remember the word as well, i.e the impression will be greater than if you juggle multiple unknown pieces of information in a sentence which will make the context less impactful and more vague.</li> <li>This is known as i+1 which is in theory the most optimal type of sentence you can encounter, where you don't understand one thing only in a sentence. In practise this isn't really feasible but it's imo still worth bringing up to support the point of good context. You will learn an expression much faster if the sentence that contains it explains the meaning for you already, which basically is a i+1 sentence. Point is don't mine from a sentence that has a significant amount of unkmown expressions you don't know leading you to mine, because the usuage of the expressions will be more vague because the whole sentence is already vague.</li> <li>Let your interest guide your immersion. If you are not having fun, then drop it and immerse in something else. In the beginning you won't have much options in what you can immerse, which will make immersion less appealing, but your interest in learning the language and the actual process of doing so should get you through the initial stage.</li> <li>Immersion is a learning process. You will have to pause and think, reread, relisten, rewind and rethink again. But don't spend minutes on one sentence. If you do so, then whatever you are immersing with is too hard for you at the moment. No interest in specific content can justify pushing yourself through it with less efficiancy. Your time is better spent immersing in something on or a bit above your level.</li> <li>Immersion is the most single important process you are going to be doing, a lot of high quality (long concentrated sessions) and consistent immersion per day can even omit the need for doing Anki daily. But Anki is still recommended to do.</li> <li>Don't whitenoise. Put in effort every sentence you read/hear and try to understand as much as you can.</li> <li>Balancing enjoyment (understanding) and ambiguity is for everybody different. You have to tolarete whitenoising i.e not understanding everything, meaning you can't understand everything always, especially at the beginning. That's why understanding (enjoyment) is the most important metric to measure if something is too hard for you.</li> <li>Most of the time at the beginning you will not be able to understand everything everytime, don't feel discouraged by this. Effort is what counts. You can't really know at the beginning, and maybe even at the advanced stage sometimes, what you are missing in a sentence to fully graps it, because you don't know enough about the language.</li> <li>Check your understand, especially at the beginning when starting out. You can check with yourself what you have read/listened to right after you read/listened to it after every few sentences or paragraphs.</li> <li>Rewatching stuff you already have seen is really helpful. You will already know the context and story which will help you tremendously with immersion and picking up the language.</li> <li>Immersion will teach you nuances of grammar, word usage and readings without you having realized you learned something. Most of the time you don't realize or feel like you are actually learning, but as long as you put in proper effort in understanding, you are learning. You will notice after a while (quite a few months) that some words just feel more right than other in certain contexts, this conjugation holds this meaning and you read that this way. You will know this because of immersion, this is acquisition of language, the same way you can feel out what feels and sounds right in your mother tongue is trying to be accomplished with immersion. Thats why immersion is king and you should prioritise it. You maximize this by immersing for longer period of time in a concentrated and focused manner where you learn and prioritise understanding.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Mindset%20and%20Mental%20Game.html#mindset","title":"Mindset","text":"<ul> <li>Do not look or compare your reading speed with anybody. Reading speed is irrelivant. Comprehension is the single most important thing. Reading speed will come with comprehension. Do not look at your reading speed. If you do, do not compare yourself with other.</li> <li>Immersion language learning is not a race or a battle or a competition who can immerse the most or who can comprehend the hardest things or who reads the fastest. Everybody has their own goals and pace. Based on these goals, everybody has their own things they should focus on to accomplish them. Comparing yourself is healthy when you get motivated by other people's progress. Everyone has their lifestyle and schedule what works for them. Don't get discouraged by the progress of others. Especially if you and their lifestyle is different. Your 2-3 hours of quality immersion are somebody's 10 hours quality immersion. You do the most you can and put in effort, this is what counts.</li> <li>Do not burnout. If you are dreading yourself to immerse i.e your immersion bores you to death, then stop and immerse in something different you are interested in. Its fine if you are no longer interested in something. This happens to everybody and don't feel sad or bad about it. Don't feel bad about dropping something even if you have been immersing with it for months. You don't lose anything by starting to immerse in something different, you only gain more. Don't think about anybody thinking bad of you for dropping things be it because of lose of interest or difficulty, remember this is YOUR journey and you should prioritise what is best for you i.e not dreading immersion. The act of realising something is not working for you and you need to change up things is not be laughed at or be demotivated by.</li> <li>If you are dreading Anki to the point where you skip it, reduce your new card amount. Immersion is more important. As long as you keep immersing consistently, Anki will become less useful, but this stage is usally reached after quite a few months or even years of immersion after having a strong foundation in the language.</li> <li>Consistency is key, just one hour of anki, reading and listening is more than enough. Slow and steady wins the race. You obviously are more than free to do more than that if you have the time and energy for it for example on weekends or whenever. There are gonna be people who immerse for +10 hours each day making you believe xou have to do the same but you absolutely don't. Consitency is key.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Setup%20Anki.html","title":"Setup Anki","text":""},{"location":"Setup%20Anki.html#what-is-anki","title":"What is Anki","text":"<p>Anki is a digital flashcard program which helps you learn and retain new information in a really effictive way.
